# state_machine_simulation using python

A state machine is a behavioral model that defines how an object behaves in response to events. In Python, a state machine is typically implemented as a finite state machine (FSM). 

An FSM is a mathematical model of computation that can be used to design digital logic circuits and computer programs. It consists of a set of states, transitions between those states, and actions that are performed when a transition occurs.

# State and Transition Definitions

The State class will represent each state, and the Transition class will represent the transitions between states based on inputs.

Task: Write code to define states and transitions.

## State Class



class State:

    def __init__(self, name):

        self.name = name

    def __repr__(self):

        return self.name



## Transition Class



class Transition:

    def __init__(self, from_state, input_symbol, to_state):

        self.from_state = from_state

        self.input_symbol = input_symbol

        self.to_state = to_state



Team 2's task is to implement the state machine simulation logic. This involves creating the Python functions or classes that will simulate the behavior of a state machine. A state machine consists of states, inputs, and transitions between states based on inputs. States represent conditions or configurations. Inputs trigger transitions from one state to another. Transitions define the relationship between current states, inputs, and the next states.
